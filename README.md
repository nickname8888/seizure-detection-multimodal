Multimodal seizure detection using wearable EEG, ECG, and ACC signals (SeizeIT2 dataset)

# About the Dataset:
The SeizeIT2 dataset stems from a multicenter, prospective study aimed at validating the Sensor Dot (SD) wearable device for monitoring patients with refractory focal epilepsy. The study, approved by the UZ Leuven ethics committee, involved 125 patients (41% female) across five European epilepsy monitoring units (EMU). The dataset contains approximately 11,640 hours of data collected between January 2020 and June 2022, including wearable bte-EEG, ECG, EMG, and movement data.

Participants, primarily adults with focal epilepsy, underwent long-term video EEG (vEEG) monitoring for presurgical evaluation. The SD device recorded data from both EEG electrodes and wearable sensors, capturing 886 focal seizures with durations ranging from 3 seconds to 16 minutes. Most seizures were focal aware or focal impaired awareness, with a majority originating in the temporal lobe. The data includes both successful and some failed recordings due to technical errors, providing valuable insights into seizure patterns and the performance of the wearable device for seizure detection.
